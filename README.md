UC PLASMA by Student Startup Center provides details for entrepreneurs with important information such as applications, educational sessions, due dates, and more.
Powered by AWS

## How it's built
Used [HTML], [CSS], and [javascript] for the website. 
Used www.GoDaddy.com for our "ucplasma.com" domain name and management.
Used Amazon EC2 from aws.amazon.com for the web service cloud to launch the website.
Had helpful templates for implementing a beautiful design.

## Challenges
When first starting this website, I had trouble making the website look nice without a designer.
I was required to do extensive research on web development on a designer's perspective. 
During the domain and website service managing, I had difficulties setting up the domain for the first time.

## Accomplishments and Learnings
After developing the first ucplasma website, I was proud of learning how to use different services to make the ucplasma website run more smoothly as well as working with my employer to find the best working ideas come in sight.
